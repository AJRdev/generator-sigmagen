# Sigmagen

Sigmagen is a Yeoman generator for cool and beautiful people that allows them to create an accessible, powerful, extendable website scaffold in less time than it takes to insult an owl.

This generator is used internally by the [Sigma UK](http://www.wearesigma.com/) front end team, and is constantly being improved upon based on feedback gained and lessons learned as a result of using it on real world client projects.

This is not a perfect generator. If you think there's areas where it can be improved, _please_ let me know. This is my first time doing anything to do with automation, and I'm always open to suggestions and new ideas!

##Features

Sigmagen allows you to create a new web project that includes:

- A pre-made gulp file that compresses JavaScript and processes Sass, along with a few other helpful tasks
- The option to build your project in either the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) or [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/) templating languages
- The option to scaffold your project using either [Bootstrap Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) or [Bourbon (+ Neat)](http://bourbon.io/)
- The option to include [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
- Base templates based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- A few handy Mixins
- A basic styleguide (based on [The Poor Man's Styleguide](http://www.poormansstyleguide.com/))
